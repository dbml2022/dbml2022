                    <p>After the increased adoption of machine learning (ML) in various applications and disciplines, a
                        synergy between the database (DB) systems and ML communities emerged. Steps involved in an ML
                        pipeline, such as data preparation and cleaning, feature engineering and management of the ML
                        lifecycle, can benefit from research conducted by the data management community. For example,
                        the management of the ML lifecycle requires mechanisms for modeling, storing and querying ML
                        artifacts. Moreover, in many use cases pipelines require a mixture of relational and linear
                        algebra operators raising the question of whether a seamless integration between the two
                        algebras is possible. In the opposite direction, ML techniques are explored in
                        core components of database systems, e.g., query optimization, indexing and monitoring.
                        Traditionally hard problems in databases, such as cardinality estimation, or problems with high
                        human supervision like DB administration, might benefit more from learning algorithms than from
                        rule-based or cost-based approaches.

                        The workshop aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners in the intersection of DB
                        and ML research, providing a forum for DB-inspired or ML-inspired approaches addressing
                        challenges encountered in each of the two areas. In particular, we welcome new research topics
                        combining the strengths of both fields.
